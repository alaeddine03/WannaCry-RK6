The script appears to define functions for analyzing the spread and impact of the WannaCry ransomware using epidemiological models. 
The initial part of the code includes functions for the derivatives of the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) 
and SIS (Susceptible, Infected, Susceptible) models, which are commonly used in epidemiology to model the spread of diseases.

Here's a brief overview of the initial part of the code:

Function Definitions for SIR Model Derivatives:

-The function dSIRdt calculates the rates of change (dSdt, dIdt, dRdt) for the susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R) compartments of the population.
-The parameters include beta (infection rate), gamma (recovery rate), and N (total population).

Function Definitions for SIS Model Derivatives:

-The function dSISdt calculates the rates of change (dSdt, dIdt) for the susceptible (S) and infected (I) compartments.
-The SIS model differs from the SIR model in that it doesn't include a recovered compartment; individuals move directly from infected back to susceptible.
-The same parameters (beta, gamma, N) are used.

Error Estimation Function:

-This part of the code seems to include a function for estimating the error between two time steps, which is likely used in simulations or numerical solutions of these models.
